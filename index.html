  <h1>Welcome to InteractR!</h1>
  <p>InteractR is a website designed for exploring protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more protein molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by interactions that include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect. </p>
  <p>PPIs have pivotal roles in life processes and are associated with various diseases, such as cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Therefore, targeting PPIs is a direction in treating diseases and an essential strategy for the development of new drugs. </p>
  <p>InteractR allows you to enter in your own protein name and get information about that protein from a central database. You can also browse through our curated list of PPIs that are linked to different biological processes and pathways.</p>
