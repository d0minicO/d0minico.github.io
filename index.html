  <h1>Welcome to InteractR!</h1>
  <p>InteractR is a website designed for exploring protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more protein molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by interactions that include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect. </p>
  <p>PPIs have pivotal roles in life processes and are associated with various diseases, such as cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Therefore, targeting PPIs is a direction in treating diseases and an essential strategy for the development of new drugs. </p>
  <p>InteractR allows you to enter in your own protein name and get information about that protein from a central database. You can also browse through our curated list of PPIs that are linked to different biological processes and pathways.</p>
  <form action="search.php" method="get">
    <label for="protein">Enter your protein name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="protein" name="protein" placeholder="e.g. p53">
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
  </form>
  <div id="results">

      if (isset($_GET['protein'])) {
        $protein = $_GET['protein'];
